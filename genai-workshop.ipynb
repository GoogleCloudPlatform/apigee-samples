    "\n",
    "Logging both prompts and candidate responses from large language models (LLMs) allows for detailed analysis and improvement of the model's performance over time. By examining past interactions, AI practitioners can identify patterns leading to refinements in the training data or model architecture. Furthermore, by examining the prompts security teams can detect malicious intent, such as attempts to extract sensitive information or generate harmful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, logging the generated candidates provides insights into the LLM's behavior and helps identify any biases or vulnerabilities in the model itself. This information can then be used to improve security measures, fine-tune the model, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM usage.\n",

    "### About Vertex AI Vector Search API and Embeddings API\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Vertex AI Vector Search**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) enables real-time, fast retrieval of embeddings, which powers a wide range of next-gen user experiences. It provices state-of-the-art embeddigs similarity search ([**ScaNN**](https://research.google/blog/announcing-scann-efficient-vector-similarity-search/)) that is foundational to Google services like Search, Play, and Youtube. It is a key enabler for Search applications and RAG. Vertex AI Vector Search offers speed, scale, quality and cost advantages over alternatives. It also has differentiated value added capabilities including incremental indexing, numerical and tag-based filtering, ensuring diversity of results, and auto-scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Vertex AI Embeddings API**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) provides a powerful way to represent text, images, and videos as numerical vectors. It allows for finding similar content based on meaning, Suggesting relevant items based on user preferences and past interactions, classifying, clustering, and detecting outliers based on semantic relationships. It is a key component of RAG architecture allowing more natural and engaging interactions with chatbots. It supports combining information from different data types for richer insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The prompt request is receved by an Apigee proxy.\n",
    "2. Apigee extracts the prompt contents and generates a numerical representation using the Vertex AI Embeddings API.\n",
    "3. Apigee performs a semantic similarity search using the Vertex AI Vector Search API.\n",
    "4. If there's a datapoint with a good similarity score, it performs a cache lookup using [**Apigee's cache**](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/cache/persistence-tools#caching).\n",
    "5. If the datapoint is found in cache, it is returned, otherwise the cache is populated with the LLM response."

   ]

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Circuit breaking with Apigee offers significant benefits for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, particularly in preventing the dreaded `429` HTTP errors that arise from exceeding LLM endpoint quotas. By placing Apigee between the RAG application and LLM endpoints, users gain a robust mechanism for managing traffic distribution and graceful failure handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where multiple tenants, each with their own LLM endpoints and associated capacity limits, are accessed by a single RAG application. Without circuit breaking, a surge in traffic to a particular tenant's LLM endpoint could trigger a `429` error, disrupting the entire RAG application's functionality. Apigee acts as a traffic cop, monitoring the health of each tenant's endpoint and implementing a circuit-breaking strategy to prevent cascading failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance resilience, users can create priority pools, grouping together LLM endpoints with similar capabilities and quota limitations. This allows Apigee to distribute traffic evenly within a pool, effectively aggregating the individual endpoint quotas and ensuring that the combined capacity can handle the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples/blob/main/llm-circuit-breaking/images/llm-circuit-breaking.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Breaking Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved fault tolerance**: The multi-pool architecture, coupled with circuit breaking, provides inherent fault tolerance, ensuring that the RAG application remains operational even if one or more LLM endpoints fail or experience outages.\n",
    "2. **Data-driven capacity planning**: Circuit breaking provides valuable insights into endpoint performance, allowing you to monitor and adjust capacity allocations based on actual traffic patterns and usage. This enables informed capacity planning and avoids unnecessary overprovisioning.\n",
    "3. **Multitenancy**: Apigee provides a unified platform for managing and routing traffic to different LLM tenants, simplifying integration and reducing development effort.\n",
    "4. **Centralized monitoring and analytics**: Apigee offers comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities, allowing for real-time insights into LLM endpoint performance, quota usage, and failover events. This enables proactive identification and resolution of issues, enhancing operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apigee receives a request and verifies the primary pool status. If it's open, then route the traffic to the primary pool. It it's closed, then traffic is routed to the secondary pool.\n",
    "2. If the request to the primary pool fails (i.e. the response returns HTTP `429` or an error code greater than `399`) then failover to the secondary pool and increase the error count in the circuit breaker.\n",
    "3. Once a maximum of 2 errors has been detected, then the primary pool is taken out of rotation and all traffic will be sent to the secondary pool.\n",
    "4. The primary pool will be returned back into rotation after a cooldown period of 2 minutes.\n",
