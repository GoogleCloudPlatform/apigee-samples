        "description": "Get to grips with the tools, services, and functions needed for application migration to help you move from legacy applications to cloud-native on Google Cloud Key FeaturesDiscover how a sample legacy application can be transformed into a cloud-native application on Google CloudLearn where to start and how to apply application modernization techniques and toolingWork with real-world use cases and instructions to modernize an application on Google CloudBook Description Legacy applications, which comprise 75–80% of all enterprise applications, often end up being stuck in data centers. Modernizing these applications to make them cloud-native enables them to scale in a cloud environment without taking months or years to start seeing the benefits. This book will help software developers and solutions architects to modernize their applications on Google Cloud and transform them into cloud-native applications. This book helps you to build on your existing knowledge of enterprise application development and takes you on a journey through the six Rs: rehosting, replatforming, rearchitecting, repurchasing, retiring, and retaining. You'll learn how to modernize a legacy enterprise application on Google Cloud and build on existing assets and skills effectively. Taking an iterative and incremental approach to modernization, the book introduces the main services in Google Cloud in an easy-to-understand way that can be applied immediately to an application. By the end of this Google Cloud book, you'll have learned how to modernize a legacy enterprise application by exploring various interim architectures and tooling to develop a cloud-native microservices-based application. What you will learnDiscover the principles and best practices for building cloud-native applicationsStudy the six Rs of migration strategy and learn when to choose which strategyRehost a legacy enterprise application on Google Compute EngineReplatform an application to use Google Load Balancer and Google Cloud SQLRefactor into a single-page application (SPA) supported by REST servicesReplatform an application to use Google Identity Platform and Firebase AuthenticationRefactor to microservices using the strangler patternAutomate the deployment process using a CI/CD pipeline with Google Cloud BuildWho this book is for This book is for software developers and solutions architects looking to gain experience in modernizing their enterprise applications to run on Google Cloud and transform them into cloud-native applications. Basic knowledge of Java and Spring Boot is necessary. Prior knowledge of Google Cloud is useful but not mandatory.",

The future will favor companies that can migrate to a management model, better suited for the times. The abilities to remain entrepreneurial and innovate constantly will be essential for all companies in an innovation economy. However, most firms still use industrial-age management models that are not suited to attracting and energizing entrepreneurial talent. This book imbibes latest results from a year-long study of Google’s approaches to management, and finds similar principles being applied at companies including, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tesla Motors, and Apigee. By distilling on the aspects that work across a variety of innovative firms, the authors present a synthesis that could have profound implications for managers everywhere.",

It provides basic principles and trends of smart mobility as well as international examples. The topic of this work is especially interesting as the future of human centered and business triggered ecosystems is increasingly dependent on the coordination capabilities of all participating and influencing members to manage transportation needs. Even more the fulfillment of the right to mobility for individual and cargo related mobility asks for mobility enablement in a predictive, digital and intermodal manner. Therefore, this book is useful not only for decision makers in several positions but also for people who are interested in trends of transportation and mobility.",
