    "# Circuit Breaking Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit breaking with Apigee offers significant benefits for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, particularly in preventing the dreaded `429` HTTP errors that arise from exceeding LLM endpoint quotas. By placing Apigee between the RAG application and LLM endpoints, users gain a robust mechanism for managing traffic distribution and graceful failure handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where multiple tenants, each with their own LLM endpoints and associated capacity limits, are accessed by a single RAG application. Without circuit breaking, a surge in traffic to a particular tenant's LLM endpoint could trigger a `429` error, disrupting the entire RAG application's functionality. Apigee acts as a traffic cop, monitoring the health of each tenant's endpoint and implementing a circuit-breaking strategy to prevent cascading failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance resilience, users can create priority pools, grouping together LLM endpoints with similar capabilities and quota limitations. This allows Apigee to distribute traffic evenly within a pool, effectively aggregating the individual endpoint quotas and ensuring that the combined capacity can handle the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples/blob/main/llm-circuit-breaking/images/llm-circuit-breaking.png?raw=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Circuit Breaking Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved fault tolerance**: The multi-pool architecture, coupled with circuit breaking, provides inherent fault tolerance, ensuring that the RAG application remains operational even if one or more LLM endpoints fail or experience outages.\n",
    "2. **Data-driven capacity planning**: Circuit breaking provides valuable insights into endpoint performance, allowing you to monitor and adjust capacity allocations based on actual traffic patterns and usage. This enables informed capacity planning and avoids unnecessary overprovisioning.\n",
    "3. **Multitenancy**: Apigee provides a unified platform for managing and routing traffic to different LLM tenants, simplifying integration and reducing development effort.\n",
    "4. **Centralized monitoring and analytics**: Apigee offers comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities, allowing for real-time insights into LLM endpoint performance, quota usage, and failover events. This enables proactive identification and resolution of issues, enhancing operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apigee recieves a request and verifies the primary pool status. If it's open, then route the traffic to the primary pool. It it's closed, then route the traffic to the secondary pool.\n",
    "2. If the request to the primary pool fails (`429` or error greater than `399`) then failover to the seconday pool and increase the error count in the circuit breaker.\n",
    "3. Once an max of 2 errors has been detected, then the primary pool is taken out of rotation and all traffic will be sent to the secondary pool.\n",
    "4. The primary pool will be returned back into rotation after a cooldown period of 2 minutes.\n",
