# Apigee Extension Processor - HTTP

This sample demonstrates how to bring [Apigee API Management](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/what-apigee) capabilities to your services that currently use [Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview). We'll illustrate this integration using a simple HTTP backend like httpbin.org. The core idea is that you can enhance your existing GCP Load Balancer services by adding a [Service Extension](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/overview), which enables the routing of HTTP requests and responses through the Apigee Gateway runtime.

With this mechanism, you gain powerful control over your API traffic. You can easily add, remove, or modify headers and payload content on the fly. More importantly, you can apply robust security and governance policies directly to your load-balanced services. This includes essential features like API Key validation for authentication and authorization, as well as quota enforcement to manage API consumption.

In essence, the Apigee Extension Processor transforms your standard load-balanced services into fully managed APIs, leveraging Apigee's comprehensive suite of API management tools without requiring a complete re-architecture. 
For more information please read the docs on the  [Apigee Extension Processor](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/service-extensions/extension-processor-overview) and [Cloud Load Balancing Service Extensions](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/lb-extensions-overview).

## Prerequisites

1. [Provision Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/provisioning-intro)
2. Have access to deploy API Proxies in Apigee,
3. Have access to create Environments and Environment Groups in Apigee
4. Have access to create API Products, Developers, and Developer Apps in Apigee
5. Have access to provision Load Balancer Resources (ip address, forwarding rule, url map, backend service, NEGs, etc)
6. Have access to create Load Balancer Service Extensions
7. Make sure the following tools are available in your terminal's $PATH (Cloud Shell has these preconfigured)
    * [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    * curl
    * jq


   
## (QuickStart) Setup using CloudShell

Use the following GCP CloudShell tutorial, and follow the instructions in Cloud Shell. Alternatively, follow the instructions below.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=extension-processor-http/docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

## Configure Environment

1.  **Authenticate:**  
    Ensure your active GCP account is selected in Cloud Shell.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

2.  **Navigate:**  
    Change to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd extension-processor-http
    ```

3.  **Configure and Source Environment:**  
    Edit `env.sh` with your settings.
  
    Then, source it to apply the settings:
    ```bash
    source ./env.sh
    ```

## Create External Global Load Balancer

In this step, let's create a new **GCP External Global Load Balancer** that uses an **Internet Network Endpoint Group (NEG)** pointing to `httpbin.org`.

The initial architecture will look like this:

<img src="images/cloud-load-balancer-request-response.png" alt="architecture" width="550"/>

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./1-create-load-balancer.sh
    ```
    This script outputs the load balancer's hostname (`$LB_HOSTNAME`).<br />
    ‚è≥ **Deployment takes about 15 minutes** due to google managed certificate provisioning. <br />
    The certificate hostname uses the nip.io DNS service. (i.e. `{IP}.nip.io`, where `{IP}`is the Load Balancer IP address.)<br />
2.  **Test the load balancer:**  
    Execute the following cURL command:
    ```bash
    curl -v -X GET https://$LB_HOSTNAME/json
    ```
    ‚úÖ You should see an HTTP `200` response with a JSON body.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you get an **SSL Error**, wait 15 minutes and retry.

## Create Apigee Resources

Next, let's set up your **Apigee Environment**, **API Proxy**, and **API Product** by running the following scripts.

1.  **Create and Attach Environment:**  
    Run the script to create an Apigee Environment (with the extension processor enabled) and attach it to a runtime instance:
    ```bash
    ./2-create-environment.sh
    ```

2.  **Create and Deploy API Proxy:**  
    Run the script to create an API proxy named `extproc-proxy` and deploy it to the new environment:
    ```bash
    ./3-create-api-proxy.sh
    ```
    This script configures the API Proxy to include a **Verify API Key** policy, which means API calls will require a valid API Key.<br />

3.  **Create API Product:**  
    Run the script to create an API Product named `extproc-product` that includes the `extproc-proxy` API Proxy:
    ```bash
    ./4-create-api-product.sh
    ```

**Important:** API traffic is **not yet routed** through Apigee. You will configure this routing in the next step.

## Create Service Extension

Next, let's modify the External Global Load Balancer by adding a Service Extension to route traffic through the Apigee runtime.

The new architecture will look like this:

<img src="images/extension-processor-request.png" alt="architecture" width="600"/>

<img src="images/extension-processor-response.png" alt="architecture" width="600"/>

1.  **Add Service Extension:**  
    Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./5-create-service-extension.sh
    ```

2.  **Test the Updated Load Balancer:**  
    Run the cURL command:
    ```bash
    curl -v -X GET https://$LB_HOSTNAME/json
    ```
    You should see the request **denied** with an API Key validation fault.<br />

    ‚úÖ This confirms traffic is now routed through the Apigee runtime, and the `VA-VerifyAPIKey` policy in the `extproc-proxy` API Proxy is triggering the fault.

In the next step, you will obtain an API Key and retry this request.

## Create Developer App

Finally, let's create an Apigee Developer App, `extproc-app`, and subscribe it to the `extproc-product` API Product.
Typically, API consumers create apps via a Developer Portal.
For this tutorial, instead, you'll create the app directly using the [Apigee CLI](https://github.com/apigee/apigeecli).

1.  **Create the Developer App:**  
    Run the following script:
    ```bash
    ./6-create-developer-app.sh
    ```
    The script will output the API Key for the new app. <br />

2.  **Test the Service with the API Key:**  
    Set the API Key as an environment variable.
    ```bash
    export DEVELOPER_APP_API_KEY="<YOUR_DEVELOPER_APP_KEY>"
    ```
    Then, send the test request:
    ```bash
    curl -v -X GET "https://${LB_HOSTNAME}/json?apikey=${DEVELOPER_APP_API_KEY}"
    ```

üéâ If you see an HTTP 200 response, congrats, you've completed this tutorial!
