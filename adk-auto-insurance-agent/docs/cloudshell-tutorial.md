# Auto Insurance Agent

---

This sample provides a set of APIs designed to act as tools for an [AI agent](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents) for auto insurance.

The agent implementation that accompanies this sample was built using Google's [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). The agent code can be found in the main ADK sample repo [here](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/apihub-auto-insurance-agent).

This repo contains the following:

1. API specifications which act as the [tools](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/) used by the agent.
    * These APIs are imported to [API hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/apihub/what-is-api-hub) and then referenced in the agent code using ADK's built-in [ApiHubToolset](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/google-cloud-tools/#apigee-api-hub-tools). This lets agent developers easily turn any existing API from their organization's API catalog into a tool with just a few lines of code.
2. An Apigee [Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies#whatisanapiproxy) implementation that serves the API responses to the agent.
    * This sample proxy implementation returns mock data generated using Gemini.

To try the sample, first follow the instructions below to deploy the API specs and proxies. Then clone the [agent implementation](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/apihub-auto-insurance-agent) and run it by following the instructions in that repo.

## Pre-Requisites

1. [Provision Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/provisioning-intro)
2. [Provision Apigee API hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/apihub/provision)
3. Configure [external access](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/configure-routing#external-access) for API traffic to your Apigee X instance
4. Enable Vertex AI in your project
5. Make sure the following tools are available in your terminal's $PATH (Cloud Shell has these preconfigured)
    - [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    - [apigeecli](https://github.com/apigee/apigeecli)
    - unzip
    - curl
    - jq

Let's get started!

## Setup environment

Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

Navigate to the 'adk-auto-insurance-agent' directory in the Cloud shell.

```sh
cd adk-auto-insurance-agent
```

Edit the provided sample `env.sh` file, and set the environment variables there.

Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="adk-auto-insurance-agent/env.sh">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to open the file in the editor

Then, source the `env.sh` file in the Cloud shell.

```sh
source ./env.sh
```

## Deploy Apigee configurations

Next, let's deploy the sample to Apigee. Just run

```bash
./deploy-adk-auto-insurance-agent.sh
```

Export the `APIKEY` variable as mentioned in the command output
