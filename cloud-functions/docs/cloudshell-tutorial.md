# Sample to use Cloud Function from an Apigee Proxy

---
This sample demonstrates how to connect to a Cloud Function from an Apigee
Proxy.

## Overview

The sample API Proxy uses a Service Account to authenticate to the Cloud Function.

Let's get started!

---

## Verify that you are Logged in

Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell.

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

---

## Set up the environment

If your Cloud Shell terminal is not in the `cloud-functions` directory, navigate there now:

```sh
cd cloud-functions
```

Edit the provided sample `env.sh` file, and modify it to set the appropriate
values for the environment variables listed there.

In this sample, your Apigee proxy may run in a separate GCP project from your
Cloud Function. Or they may be in the same project. Set the appropriate
variables, depending on your preference.  You must have already created a
distinct project for Cloud Functions, if you want to use two distinct projects.

Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloud-functions/env.sh">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to open the file in the editor.

Save the file. Then, source the `env.sh` file in the Cloud shell.

```sh
source ./env.sh
```

---

## Set the project

```sh
gcloud config set project $APIGEE_PROJECT
```

## Enable APIs

Ensure that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project. This includes the
APIs for Cloud Functions, IAM, Cloud Build, Cloud Run and Artifact Registry, as
well as Logging.

```sh
gcloud services enable \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  iam.googleapis.com \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  logging.googleapis.com
```

---

## Create service accounts

This sample uses two service accounts: one to provide the identity of the Cloud
Function, and another to provide the identity of the Apigee API proxy. These
service accounts may be in different GCP projects, if you are running your Cloud
Function in a different GCP Project than your Apigee. Or they may be in the same
project.  The projects are those you set in the prior step, in your modified
`env.sh` file.

Let's create the service accounts now.

First, set the name of the Service Account that will provide the identity for the Cloud Function:

```sh
CF_SA_NAME=cf-apigee-sample-sa-1
```

Create the  Service Account:

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts create "$CF_SA_NAME" --project "$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_PROJECT"
```

Capture the email address of that service account:

```sh
CF_SA_EMAIL="${CF_SA_NAME}@${CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

Now, set the name of the Service Account that will provide the identity of the Apigee proxy:

```sh
PROXY_SA_NAME=proxy-apigee-sample-sa-1
```

Create that Service Account:

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts create "$PROXY_SA_NAME" --project "$APIGEE_PROJECT"
```

Capture the email address of that service account also:

```sh
PROXY_SA_EMAIL="${PROXY_SA_NAME}@${APIGEE_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

---

## The Cloud Function

In this sample, the logic for the cloud function is implemented in nodejs. This
app will be triggered by an HTTP request, and responds with a very simple
"Hello, World" response.  Have a look at the app now.

Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file
filePath="cloud-functions/app/app.js">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to
open the app.js file in the editor.

If you know nodejs, you could modify this app to do whatever you like. For now,
let's keep it as is.

## Deploy the Cloud Function - Allowing Unauthenticated Access

Back to the terminal. Insure you are in the `app` subdirectory.

```sh
cd app
```

Now, deploy the simple app as a function.

```sh
gcloud functions deploy "$CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME" \
  --gen2 \
  --project="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_PROJECT" \
  --runtime=nodejs18 \
  --region="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REGION" \
  --source=. \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --service-account="${CF_SA_EMAIL}" \
  --entry-point=hello-sample \
  --trigger-http
```

This command uses `--allow-unauthenticated`, which means this function will
allow un-authenticated access.

This will take a few moments. When the command finishes, you will see a
url. That provides the URL you can use to invoke the function. Let's capture
that url:

```sh
CF_URL=$(gcloud functions describe "$CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME" --region="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REGION" --format='value(serviceConfig.uri)')
```

And then invoke the function:

```sh
curl -i $CF_URL/hello-sample
```

You'll see that the request succeeds. You should see a 200 status code, and a
"Hello, World" message. The Cloud function is allowing any access.

## Deploy the Cloud Function - but Require Authentication for Access

Now, deploy again, but specify that you want to require authentication for access:

```sh
gcloud functions deploy "$CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME" \
  --gen2 \
  --project="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_PROJECT" \
  --runtime=nodejs18 \
  --region="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REGION" \
  --source=. \
  --no-allow-unauthenticated \
  --service-account="${CF_SA_EMAIL}" \
  --entry-point=hello-sample \
  --trigger-http
```

Notice that now, this command uses `--no-allow-unauthenticated`, which means
this function will be accessible only from an authenticated and authorized
client.

Again, this will take a few moments. The URL will be the same.

When deployment completes, invoke the function again, in the same way, with no authentication:

```sh
curl -i $CF_URL/hello-sample
```

Because the Cloud Function now requires authentication, and because this request
didn't pass any credentials, you will expect to see a response with a 403 status
code and a "Forbidden" error message.  But the request may succeed!  [Updating IAM policy
is an "eventually consistent"
operation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation).

So if it does return a 200 status, you may need to wait a bit here, perhaps 2
minutes, for that change in authentication settings to take effect.

Re-try the curl command, waiting a bit each time, until you see the 403 response code.

The Cloud Function now requires authentication, and the request we sent did not
provide an identity token. Let's correct that.

---

## Obtain an Identity Token

You will want to obtain an identity token, for the Service Account that
identifies the Apigee API Proxy. First, grant rights to yourself to do so:

```sh
WHOAMI=$(gcloud config list account --format "value(core.account)")
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$PROXY_SA_EMAIL" \
    --project="$APIGEE_PROJECT" \
    --member="user:${WHOAMI}" \
    --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
```

Now obtain the identity token identifying the Service Account. Notice that we
need to specify the `audience`, in the request for the token. The Cloud Function
will accept only Identity Tokens that correctly identify itself as the audience.

```sh
PAYLOAD='{"audience":"'${CF_URL}'","includeEmail":"true"}'
SA_ID_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d $PAYLOAD \
    "https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/${PROXY_SA_EMAIL}:generateIdToken" | jq -r '.token')
```

You can examine that Identity token if you wish:
```sh
echo $SA_ID_TOKEN
```

It should look like a JWT.

And now, pass that token in the invocation of the cloud function:

```sh
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $SA_ID_TOKEN" "$CF_URL/hello-sample"
```

What happens?  You should again see a 403 response code, with a www-authenticate
header telling you the caller has insufficient scope.

```
HTTP/2 403
www-authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope"
```


Why? The request included
an ID token with the correct audience. What's missing?

We need to grant permission to the Proxy Service Account, to invoke the Cloud
Function.

---

## Grant permission to the Service Account to invoke the Function

This command says, "allow the given service account to invoke the specific Cloud Function":

```sh
gcloud functions add-invoker-policy-binding "$CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME" \
    --member="serviceAccount:${PROXY_SA_EMAIL}" \
    --region="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REGION" \
    --project="$CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_PROJECT"

```

You may need to wait a bit here, perhaps 2 minutes, for that change to take
effect. [Updating IAM policy is an "eventually consistent"
operation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation).  After
the permissions get propagated, you can retry the curl command:

```sh
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $SA_ID_TOKEN" "$CF_URL/hello-sample"
```

...and you'll see that it works. If it fails with the same 403 message, wait a
bit, and try again.

We have shown that the Cloud Function will allow an authenticated request
bearing the ID token of a particular service account. Now let's use the API
Proxy to do that.

## The API Proxy

The configuration files for the Apigee API Proxy, which are stored in the
filesystem, already contain the appropriate configuration that tells Apigee to
use the identity of a service account for calls to the upstream.

Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="cloud-functions/bundle/cloud-function-http-trigger/apiproxy/targets/target-1.xml">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to open the TargetEndpoint file in your editor.

Scroll down to view the `Audience` element and the `URL` elements. It should look something like this:

```xml
  ...
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <Authentication>
      <GoogleIDToken>
        <Audience>https://apigee-sample-hello-SOMETHING.a.run.app/apigee-sample-hello</Audience>
      </GoogleIDToken>
    </Authentication>

    <SSLInfo>
      <Enabled>true</Enabled>
      <Enforce>true</Enforce>
    </SSLInfo>

    <!-- the proxy.pathsuffix will get appended -->
    <URL>https://apigee-sample-hello-SOMETHING.a.run.app/apigee-sample-hello</URL>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
  ...
```

They each hold a placeholder value now, but they need to contain the value of the Cloud
Function URL. Let's use a script to modify those values.

In the terminal, change to the directory that holds the API proxy configuration files.
If your terminal window is in the `app` directory currently, this command will do it:

```sh
cd ..
```

Then modify the `Audience` and `URL` elements:

```sh
./prepare-api-proxy.sh
```

Now, again look in your editor and see that the elements have been updated.

The configuration tells Apigee to generate an ID token, for its service account,
and pass it to the upstream target. Which service account?  The one you specify
when you deploy the API Proxy. We'll do that next.

## Import and Deploy the proxy into Apigee

Now, import and deploy the API Proxy. The API Proxy will use as its identity,
the Service Account you previously created for the API Proxy.

```sh
./import-and-deploy-proxy.sh
```

Deployment takes a few moments. The command will terminate when deployment is complete.

---

## Invoke the Apigee Proxy

After deployment of the API proxy succeeds, the proxy is ready to handle inbound
REST requests.

The URL for the Apigee proxy is a concatenation of:

- the scheme: `https://`
- the Apigee hostname
- the proxy basepath, `/v1/samples/cloud-function-http-trigger`
- the path suffix, `/hello-sample`

Let's send a GET request.

```sh
curl -i "https://$APIGEE_HOST/v1/samples/cloud-function-http-trigger/hello-sample"
```

You can see the output from the Cloud Function. It should be a 200 status code,
with the "Hello, World" message. The API Proxy has successfully connected to the Cloud Function.

## Commentary on Credentials

Your curl command sent no Authorization header. During handling of the inbound
request, the Apigee proxy created the appropriate Authorization header,
containing a token that identifies the appropriate Service Account. The proxy
then passed that Authorization header in the request that it sends to the target
cloud function.

Typically, an Apigee proxy will perform "security mediation" - it accepts one
kind of credential on input, and uses a different credential for requests sent
to the target. The input credential might be an OAuth2 access token issued by
Apigee, while the credential used for the target could be an ID token, if the
target is a cloud function.

In this particular sample, the Apigee proxy did not require any credential on
the inbound request. But that is only because this is a simplified sample. You
could easily modify this sample so that the proxy requires an API key or OAuth2
token.

## Extra Credit

If you like, you can try:

1. Using the Cloud Console UI, open a debugsession on the Apigee API Proxy, to
   examine the flow of data from the client to the Proxy, and from the Proxy to
   the Cloud Function.

2. Modifying the API proxy.

   - modify the `<Audience>` in the proxy to specify a different URL
   - remove the `<Authentication>` element entirely

   ... and in each case, re-import and re-deploy the proxy (use the
   `./import-and-deploy-proxy.sh` script), then re-try the request.  What results
   do you expect to see?

3. Modifying the app.js logic, to do something more interesting - for example,
   read from a storage bucket or a database, etc.  Be sure to re-deploy the
   Cloud Function after each modification.

   If you do modify and redeploy the Cloud Function, you don't _necessarily_
   need to also modify the API Proxy.
