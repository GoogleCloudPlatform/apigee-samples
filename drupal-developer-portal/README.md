## About Drupal developer portals

Apigee's [Drupal developer portal](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/drupal/open-source-drupal) enables users to quickly and easily stand up a highly customizable developer portal for their APIs. Unlike the [Integrated developer portal](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/portal/build-integrated-portal), the Drupal portal isn't managed by Apigee. So we will use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace solution to deploy the portal's infrastructure. To learn more about the available options for Apigee developer portals, see the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/intro-portals).

## Implementation on Apigee

The Apigee proxy sample uses only a few policies:

1. A VerifyAPIKey policy to verify incoming request credentials
2. A CORS policy to allow requests from the developer portal webpage

## Prerequisites

1. [Provision Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/provisioning-intro)
2. Configure [external access](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/configure-routing#external-access) for API traffic to your Apigee X instance
3. Have the permissions to deploy API proxies, create Apigee products, and launch the [Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bap-marketplace/apigee-drupal-devportal) Marketplace solution
4. Make sure the following tools are available in your terminal's $PATH (Cloud Shell has these preconfigured)
    * [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    * unzip
    * curl
    * jq
    * npm

## (QuickStart) Setup using CloudShell

Use the following GCP CloudShell tutorial, and follow the instructions in Cloud Shell. Alternatively, follow the instructions below.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=drupal-developer-portal/docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

## Setup instructions

1. Clone the apigee-samples repo, and switch to the drupal-developer-portal directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples.git
cd apigee-samples/drupal-developer-portal
```

2. Edit the `env.sh` and configure the ENV vars

* `PROJECT` the project where your Apigee organization is located
* `APIGEE_HOST` the externally reachable hostname of the Apigee environment group that contains APIGEE_ENV
* `APIGEE_ENV` the Apigee environment where the demo resources should be created

Now source the `env.sh` file

```bash
source ./env.sh
```

3. Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

## Deploy Apigee components

Next, let's deploy some Apigee resources necessary to set up the Drupal developer portal

```bash
./deploy-drupal-developer-portal.sh
```

**NOTE: This script creates an API Proxy and API product. It does not, however, create the developer portal. We will create and test that manually**

## Configure Drupal Developer Portal

Now we will configure our Drupal Developer Portal and expose our Apigee API product through it

### Launch Marketplace Solution

Follow the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/drupal/get-started-cloud-marketplace) to deploy the Drupal portal infrastructure using the Marketplace Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart solution. Name your deployment `sample-drupal-developer-portal` and be sure to [enable HTTPS](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/drupal/apigee-cloud-marketplace-customize#https) under Networking during portal configuration. All other configurations can be left with default values.

* If your portal has errors or does not load properly check Cloud Logging for details as it may fail silently with issues like org policy restrictions.
* This Marketplace solution may take up to an hour to deploy

### Finish Portal Configuration and Sync with Apigee

Here we will enter our portal, configure its admin account, and sync it with our Apigee organization

1. Once portal deployment is complete, navigate to the [Deployment Manager Deployments](https://console.cloud.google.com/dm/deployments) page in the GCP. Find your Drupal deployment and click into it
2. Once your portal has finished initializing, access your app using the https site link and sign into your app using the basic auth credentials found underneath the link
3. Verify details after sign in and complete Drupal installation
4. Configure Apigee: Configure the endpoint to reflect Apigee X and paste in your Apigee Org ID
5. Configure Site: Configure your site with the information and admin account of your choosing. Be sure that you have no typos when defining this information
6. Install Demo Content: Choose to enable Demo Content and click Save and Continue

### Add Apigee Product to the Drupal API Catalog

Now we will add our `sample-drupal-developer-portal-product` to our Drupal API Catalog. This section takes place within the Drupal portal and assumes that you are signed into your admin account. If you don't see the admin bar at the top of your site then sign in with the admin account that you created in the previous section.

1. From the Drupal portal, navigate to Content > API Catalog
2. Click the "+ OpenAPI" button
3. Configure as shown below

* Name: Sample Drupal Developer Portal API
* Description: A portal for an API key protected proxy
* Image: Image of your choice (optional)
* Specification Source Type: File
* OpenAPI specification: Use the [drupal-developer-portal.yaml](drupal-developer-portal.yaml) OpenAPI document from this repo:
  * If you ran the deployment script from Cloud Shell:
    * Navigate back to Cloud Shell
    * Open drupal-developer-portal.yaml & download it to your local computer. No need to update file content as it was already updated when running the deployment script.
  * Otherwise, do the following:
    * Download [drupal-developer-portal.yaml](drupal-developer-portal.yaml) to your local computer
    * Open the file and replace `[APIGEE_HOST]` with your own Apigee host/domain.
  * Upload your updated drupal-developer-portal.yaml file as API documentation
* Leave all other fields as their default values.

4. Click save

### Create API App in Drupal

Now we will create ourselves an App within Drupal. This will create us an API key which we will need to call the API

1. From the Drupal homepage, navigate to Apps. The button is in the navbar next to the My account and Log out buttons
2. Click the Add app button. Name your new app "Sample Drupal Developer Portal App", leave Callback URL blank as well as the Description, finally make sure that the `sample-drupal-developer-portal-product` is selected.
3. Click the Add app button to save
4. Within your new Sample Drupal Developer Portal App, copy the Consumer Key. You'll use this for authenticating into your API

## Test Drupal Developer Portal

Finally, we will test out our Drupal portal by making secured requests to our API through it

1. Navigate to your Drupal portal Homepage. Scroll down to find your Sample Drupal Developer Portal API. Click into it.
2. From within the API select the "Authorize" button and save your API Key within
3. Select the / GET call from under API REFERENCE. Under Try this API click EXECUTE
4. Voila! You have a working API secured and documented within your Marketplace Drupal Portal!

## Conclusion & Cleanup

To clean up the artifacts created:

First, you need to delete the resources we manually created

1. From the Apigee console, navigate to Publish > Developers
2. Find the account you created in your developer portal, hover over it, and select the trash can icon to delete. This will also delete all Apigee Apps associated with your developer
3. From the GCP Deployment Manager Deployments page select your `sample-drupal-developer-portal` deployment and click delete at the top. A popup will be shown, be sure to select the option to delete all resources associated with the Drupal portal.

After that, source your `env.sh` script and run the following to delete your product and proxy:

```bash
./clean-up-drupal-developer-portal.sh
```
