# Integrated developer portal

---
This sample lets you create an integrated developer portal for your API product

Let's get started!

---

## Setup environment

Navigate to the 'integrated-developer-portal' drirectory in the Cloud Shell.

```sh
cd integrated-developer-portal
```

Edit the provided sample `env.sh` file, and set the environment variables there.

Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="integrated-developer-portal/env.sh">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to open the file in the editor

Then, source the `env.sh` file in the Cloud shell.

```sh
source ./env.sh
```

Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell

```sh
gcloud auth login
```
---

## Deploy Apigee components

Next, let's deploy the Apigee resources necessary to create an integrated developer portal

```sh
./deploy-integrated-developer-portal.sh
```

This script creates an API Proxy and API product. It does not, however, create the developer portal. We will create and test that manually.

## Conclusion

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! You've successfully created an API secured proxy and an associated API product. Now we need to create the integrated developer portal & test the API with it.

Navigate back to the Github README.md doc where we first started. Find the "Create Integrated Developer Portal" section and pick up from there.

## Cleanup

After you create your integrated developer portal you can clean up the artifacts from this sample in your Apigee Organization

First, you need to manually delete some Apigee resources
1. Navigate to Publish > Developers
2. Find the account you created in your developer portal, hover over it, and select the trash can icon to delete. This will also delete all Apigee Apps associated with your developer
3. Navigate to Publish > Portals
4. Find your Sample Integrated Developer Portal, hover over it, and select the trash can icon to delete

After that, source your `env.sh` script, and then run

```bash
./clean-up-integrated-developer-portal.sh
```
