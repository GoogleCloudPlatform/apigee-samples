# Integrated Developer Portal

This sample lets you create an integrated developer portal for your API product

## About integrated developer portals

Apigee's integrated developer portal enables users to quickly and easily stand up a developer portal for their APIs. These portals are fully supported by Google and offer premium capabilities for the majority of developer portal needs. To learn more, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/portal/build-integrated-portal).

## How it works


## Implementation on Apigee 

The Apigee proxy sample uses only a few policies:
1. An API Key policy to verify incoming request API Key credentials
2. A CORS policy to allow requests from the developer portal webpage

## Prerequisites
1. [Provision Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/provisioning-intro)
2. Configure [external access](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/configure-routing#external-access) for API traffic to your Apigee X instance
3. Make sure the following tools are available in your terminal's $PATH (Cloud Shell has these preconfigured)
    * [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    * unzip
    * curl
    * jq
    * npm

# (QuickStart) Setup using CloudShell

Use the following GCP CloudShell tutorial, and follow the instructions in Cloud Shell. Alternatively, follow the instructions below.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=integrated-developer-portal/docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

## Setup instructions

1. Clone the apigee-samples repo, and switch the integrated-developer-portal directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples.git
cd apigee-samples/integrated-developer-portal
```

2. Edit the `env.sh` and configure the ENV vars

* `PROJECT` the project where your Apigee organization is located
* `APIGEE_HOST` the externally reachable hostname of the Apigee environment group that contains APIGEE_ENV
* `APIGEE_ENV` the Apigee environment where the demo resources should be created

Now source the `env.sh` file

```bash
source ./env.sh
```

3. Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

4. Deploy the Apigee resources necessary to create an integrated developer portal

```bash
./deploy-integrated-developer-portal.sh
```

This script creates an API Proxy and API product. It does not, however, create the developer portal. We will create and test that manually.

## Create Integrated Developer Portal

You've successfully created a secured Apigee proxy. Now we need to create the integrated developer portal:

1. Access the portals page from the [Apigee homepage](https://apigee.google.com). Publish > Portals
2. Click the +Portal button
3. For name you can use "Sample Integrated Developer Portal". You can leave Description blank.

We also need to add our API product to the portal:

1. Access your new Sample Integrated Developer Portal
2. Enter the API catalog tab, if not already selected
3. Click + to add a new API product to the catalog
4. Select the sample-integrated-developer-portal-product product and click next
5. Configure as shown below
- Published: Select published (checked)
- Display title: Leave default name, sample-integrated-developer-portal-product
- Display description: A portal for an API key protected proxy
- Require developers to specify a callback URL: Keep deselected (unchecked)
- Audience: Anonymous users (anyone can view)
- API product image: Image of your choice
- API documentation: Use the [integrated-developer-portal.yaml](integrated-developer-portal.yaml) OpenAPI document from this repo:
    - Download [integrated-developer-portal.yaml](integrated-developer-portal.yaml) to your local computer. If you ran the deployment script from Cloud Shell, then download the file from your Shell editor. Otherwise, you will need to manually update the file to replace "\[APIGEE_HOST\]" with your own Apigee host.
    - Upload your updated integrated-developer-portal.yaml as API documentation
6. Scroll up and click save

## Test Integrated Developer Portal

Now that we have a developer portal, let's walk through its workflow. First we'll create our create our developer account and sign in, then we'll make an Apigee app complete with a client id and secret, and finally we'll use the client id to authorize our requests and test our API. To do so, follow the steps below: 

1. Navigate to your newly created portal. Portals > Sample Integrated Developer Portal
2. Enter the portal by clicking the Live Portal button at the top right, or with the following URL: https://\[APIGEE-ORG\]-sampleintegrateddeveloperportal.apigee.io
3. Click the Sign In button and create an account. You need to enter a valid email as the portal necessitate an email confirmation. Note: this creates an Apigee developer account
4. Navigate back to your portal's homepage (https://\[APIGEE-ORG\]-sampleintegrateddeveloperportal.apigee.io) and make sure that you're signed in
5. Open the dropdown menu by clicking on your account and select Apps
6. Select +NEW APP and update the following fields. Note: this creates an Apigee App for your developer
- App Name: Sample App
- APIs: Enable sample-integrated-developer-portal-product
7. Click the SAVE button
8. Click into APIs from the top navbar
9. Click into your sample-integrated-developer-portal-product
10. Select AUTHORIZE and select your app from the dropdown. This authorizes all of your portal requests with your App's API key
11. Select the / GET request Path
12. Under Try this API, click the EXECUTE button
13. You should receive a 200 OK response from Apigee. The body of the response is a copy of the request data you sent to Apigee

## Cleanup

After you create your integrated developer portal you can clean up the artifacts from this sample in your Apigee Organization

First, you need to manually delete some Apigee resources
1. Navigate to Publish > Developers
2. Find the account you created in your developer portal, hover over it, and select the trash can icon to delete. This will also delete all Apigee Apps associated with your developer
3. Navigate to Publish > Portals
4. Find your Sample Integrated Developer Portal, hover over it, and select the trash can icon to delete

After that, source your `env.sh` script, and then run

```bash
./clean-up-integrated-developer-portal.sh
```
