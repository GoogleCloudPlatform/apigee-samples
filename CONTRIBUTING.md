# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few guidelines you need to follow.


## General Guidelines

1. The primary focus of this repo is to provide introductory Apigee samples of low to medium complexity, aimed at developers who are new to Apigee
    - More complex projects may be better suited for the [Apigee DevRel](https://github.com/apigee/devrel) repo
1. Projects in this repo are targeted for [Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs) and [hybrid](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/latest/what-is-hybrid). We do not accept samples for the Apigee Edge platform (these may be found [here](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples))
    - More information about the different versions of Apigee can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/compare-apigee-products)
1. Projects accepted to this repository should be considered a recommended best practice by Apigee's product management, field engineers, customers and community
1. For large pull requests (e.g. rewrites of large portions or entire projects), please first propose the changes via a new GitHub [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples/issues/new/choose) and discuss with the community before submitting a PR
