## <a name="intro"></a>Intro

This GitHub repository contains a hands-on workshop that shows how to build an intelligent AI-powered customer service agent using Apigee, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). By following a narrative about Cymbal Retail, a fictional company with siloed data, you'll learn how to transform APIs into "tools" for an AI agent, connect systems using Application Integration, and secure and manage all AI traffic with an Apigee API gateway. The workshop provides a complete, practical guide to building and operationalizing a Gemini-powered agent system in a Google Cloud environment.
