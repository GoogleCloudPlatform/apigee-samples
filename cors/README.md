# CORS Security

This sample lets you create an API that uses the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) mechanism to allow requests from external webpages and applications

## About CORS Security

CORS is a standard solution to the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) that is enforced by all browsers. CORS allows you to opt-in to serve requests from non-origin requests.

Apigee's [CORS policy](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/cors-policy) offers a simple CORS solution for your APIs. Consider this policy if you desire to call your Apigee proxy from a different domain. CORS policies can also allow/deny other request parameters such as the method or header.

## Implementation on Apigee

The Apigee proxy sample is a no-target proxy with only a single policy; a CORS policy that allows access for all cross-origin domains. This CORS policy, however, comes with a condition to only execute on requests that end with a /allow path suffix. So if a cross-origin request does no meet this condition than it will fail.

## Prerequisites

1. [Provision Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/provisioning-intro)
2. Configure [external access](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/configure-routing#external-access) for API traffic to your Apigee X instance
3. Have access to deploy proxies in Apigee
4. Make sure the following tools are available in your terminal's $PATH (Cloud Shell has these preconfigured)
    * [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    * unzip
    * curl
    * jq
    * npm

## (QuickStart) Setup using CloudShell

Use the following GCP CloudShell tutorial, and follow the instructions in Cloud Shell. Alternatively, follow the instructions below.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=cors/docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

## Setup instructions

1. Clone the apigee-samples repo, and switch to the cors directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples.git
cd apigee-samples/cors
```

2. Ensure you have an active GCP account selected in the Cloud shell

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

3. Edit the `env.sh` and configure the ENV vars

* `PROJECT` the project where your Apigee organization is located
* `APIGEE_HOST` the externally reachable hostname of the Apigee environment group that contains APIGEE_ENV
* `APIGEE_ENV` the Apigee environment where the demo resources should be created

Now source the `env.sh` file

```bash
source ./env.sh
```

## Deploy Apigee components

Next, let's deploy our sample-cors proxy. This proxy will include two [proxy endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies#whatisanapiproxy), nocors and enabled. Both are no-target proxy endpoints but the enabled endpoint includes a [CORS policy](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/cors-policy) to allow cross-origin requests.

```bash
./deploy-cors.sh
```

## Test CORS Proxy

Now that our API proxy is deployed, let's enable the debugger so we can see requests as they come through:

1. Navigate to the [Apigee homepage](https://apigee.google.com). Go to Develop > API Proxies and click into the sample-cors proxy
2. Navigate to the debug tab
3. Choose to start a debug session for the currently deployed proxy version

With the proxy debugger still running, call the sample CORS proxy from a cross origin client:

1. Navigate to an online HTTP request service such as [test-cors.org](https://test-cors.org). The requests need to be sent from an online service and should not be sent from your local machine.
2. First let's see what it looks like when a request fails due to CORS. From [test-cors.org](https://test-cors.org) find the Remote URL field and enter in your proxy's URL, https://\[APIGEE_HOST\]/v1/samples/cors/nocors. Leave all other fields at their default values.
3. Click the Send Request button and view the response. Your request will fail as it does not meet the conditions necessary to execute the CORS-AddCORS policy within Apigee. To see the CORS error message open up your browser console. In Chrome this is done by right clicking the web page, selecting "Inspect", and then choosing the "Console" tab. You should see an error message that says "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://\[APIGEE_HOST\]/v1/samples/cors/nocors' from origin '<https://test-cors.org>' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
4. Navigate to the Apigee debugger. Despite the CORS error you should still see a 200 status code for that request. While 200 status codes usually indicate success we know that in this case the request was blocked by the browser due to CORS.
5. Now let's trigger a successful cross-origin request. Navigate back to [test-cors.org](https://test-cors.org), find the Remote URL field, and enter in this URL, https://\[APIGEE_HOST\]/v1/samples/cors/enabled. Leave all other fields at their default values
6. Click the Send Request button and view the response. You should see a 200 status code this time, meaning that the response returned back to the client successfully!
7. Navigate to the Apigee debugger. You will still see a 200 status code for that request but this time we know that the request wasn't blocked by the browser. This is because our enabled proxy endpoint enforces the "CORS-AddCORS" policy in the preflow for all incoming requests.
8. Now let's trigger a request with a [CORS preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request). CORS preflight requests are sent ahead of your request when your request [is not simple](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So far, all of our requests have been simple so let's change that for our next test by adding ```foo: bar``` to the "Request Headers" field in test-cors.org. Our CORS-AddCORS proxy policy has already been configured to allow the new header "foo".
9. Click the Send Request button and view the response. You should see a 200 status code, meaning that the response returned back to the client successfully!
10. Navigate to the Apigee debugger. You will still see a 200 status code for your GET request but you should also see an OPTIONS request as well. That OPTIONS request was our preflight request sent by CORS to ensure that our API is properly configured before sending the GET request. The preflight success will be cached for a time as described by our CORS-AddCORS policy's [MaxAge](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/cors-policy#max-age) element.

### Further Notes on CORS

Please note that our CORS policy allows requests from all origins, which is typically not a recommended practice for production APIs. Please supplement this sample with [further learning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to fully understand CORS security. Also, be sure read the policy documentation to understand how concepts like [allowed origins](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/cors-policy#allow-origins) and [allowed methods](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/policies/cors-policy#allow-methods) are enforced in Apigee.

## Conclusion & Cleanup

Congratulations! You've successfully created a CORS secured Apigee API.

To clean up the artifacts created source your `env.sh` script and run the following to delete your sample CORS proxy:

```bash
./clean-up-cors.sh
```
