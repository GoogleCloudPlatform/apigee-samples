Feature:
  As an Apigee platform explorer
  I want to experiment with API Product Operations while using OAuth tokens
  So that I can understand how Operations work

  Scenario Outline: missing Token
    When I GET /token/users
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be oauth.v2.InvalidAccessToken

  Scenario Outline: get a token for viewer
    Given I have basic authentication credentials `viewerClientId` and `viewerClientSecret`
      And I set Content-Type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      And I set body to grant_type=client_credentials
    When I POST to -oauth2-cc/token
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.token_type should be Bearer
      And I store the value of body path $.access_token as VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN in global scope

  Scenario Outline: get a token for creator
    Given I have basic authentication credentials `creatorClientId` and `creatorClientSecret`
      And I set Content-Type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      And I set body to grant_type=client_credentials
    When I POST to -oauth2-cc/token
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.token_type should be Bearer
      And I store the value of body path $.access_token as CREATOR_ACCESSTOKEN in global scope

  Scenario Outline: get a token for admin
    Given I have basic authentication credentials `adminClientId` and `adminClientSecret`
      And I set Content-Type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      And I set body to grant_type=client_credentials
    When I POST to -oauth2-cc/token
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.token_type should be Bearer
      And I store the value of body path $.access_token as ADMIN_ACCESSTOKEN in global scope

  Scenario Outline: unknown resource
    Given I set TOKEN header to `VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I GET /token/unknown-resource
    Then response code should be 400
    And response body path $.response.message should be that request was unknown

  Scenario Outline: list users ok
    Given I set TOKEN header to `VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I GET /token/users
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.status should be OK
      And response body path $.verb should be GET
      And response body path $.apiproduct-operation-resource should be /*/users

  Scenario Outline: list users reject
    Given I set TOKEN header to `CREATOR_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I GET /token/users
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.InvalidAPICallAsNoApiProductMatchFound

  Scenario Outline: get single user ok
    Given I set TOKEN header to `VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I GET /token/users/1234
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.status should be OK
      And response body path $.verb should be GET
      And response body path $.apiproduct-operation-resource should be /*/users/*

  Scenario Outline: get single user reject
    Given I set TOKEN header to `CREATOR_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I GET /token/users/1234
    Then response code should be 401
      And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.InvalidAPICallAsNoApiProductMatchFound

  Scenario Outline: create user reject
    Given I set TOKEN header to `VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN`
      And I set Content-Type header to text/plain
      And I set body to does-not-matter
    When I POST to /token/users
    Then response code should be 401
      And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.InvalidAPICallAsNoApiProductMatchFound

  Scenario Outline: create user ok
    Given I set TOKEN header to `CREATOR_ACCESSTOKEN`
      And I set Content-Type header to text/plain
      And I set body to does-not-matter
    When I POST to /token/users
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.status should be OK
      And response body path $.verb should be POST
      And response body path $.apiproduct-operation-resource should be /*/users


  Scenario Outline: delete user reject 1
    Given I set TOKEN header to `VIEWER_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I DELETE /token/users/1234
    Then response code should be 401
      And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.InvalidAPICallAsNoApiProductMatchFound

  Scenario Outline: delete user reject 2
    Given I set TOKEN header to `CREATOR_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I DELETE /token/users/1234
    Then response code should be 401
      And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.InvalidAPICallAsNoApiProductMatchFound

  Scenario Outline: delete user ok
    Given I set TOKEN header to `ADMIN_ACCESSTOKEN`
    When I DELETE /token/users/1234
    Then response code should be 200
      And response body path $.status should be OK
      And response body path $.verb should be DELETE
      And response body path $.apiproduct-operation-resource should be /*/users/*
