## API Product Operations

This sample shows how to use API Product Operations to limit the particular
verb/path combinations that will be permitted for an authenticated caller
application.

Let's get started!

---

## Setup environment

1. Check your credentials.
   ```sh
   gcloud auth print-access-token
   ```

   If you see a token, then you're authenticated.

   If you do not see a token, then
   gcloud will advise you to login. Do so:

   ```sh
   gcloud auth login
   ```

   When you do that, you _may_ see a warning, telling you:

   > You are already authenticated with gcloud when running
   > inside the Cloud Shell and so do not need to run this
   > command. Do you wish to proceed anyway?

   Ignore that :). Proceed anyway.


2. Navigate to the `apiproduct-operations` directory in the Cloud shell.

   ```sh
   cd apiproduct-operations
   ```

   Edit the provided sample `env.sh` file, and set the environment variables there.

   Click <walkthrough-editor-open-file
   filePath="apiproduct-operations/env.sh">here</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
   to open the file in the editor

   Then, save your changes, and source the `env.sh` file in the Cloud Shell.

   ```sh
   source ./env.sh
   ```

---

## Deploy Apigee components

Next, let's create and deploy the Apigee resources necessary to test the quota policy.

```sh
./setup-apiproduct-operations.sh
```

This script imports two sample API Proxies from the filesystem, lints them, and
then deploys them. The script then creates a Developer entity, three API
products with different Operations settings, and three Apps, each one authorized
for just one of those products.

The script also tests that the deployment and configuration has been sucessful.

---

## Test the APIs using API Key Verification (A)

When the script finishes, it prints the proxy and app
information you will need to run the commands below.

1. First, set the required shell variables:
   ```sh
   export VIEWER_CLIENT_ID=<replace with script output>
   export CREATOR_CLIENT_ID=<replace with script output>
   export ADMIN_CLIENT_ID=<replace with script output>
   ```

2. Now, run the following command, intended to be the kind of REST request an
   app might send to list items in a collection:

   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$VIEWER_CLIENT_ID
   ```

   This request uses the API Key authorized for the VIEWER product. You should see
   a 200 response. This API does not actually return a list of users; it's
   returning a status of the credential check.  Observe the success response; it
   will show the the name of the API Product, the path of the authorized resource,
   and the verb used.


## Test the APIs using API Key Verification (B)

3. Now, run the same request but with a different key, the one for the CREATOR:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$CREATOR_CLIENT_ID
   ```

   You should now see a rejection response, with a status of 401 Unauthorized,
   indicating that when an app uses the credential authorized for the CREATOR
   Product to request a list of users, Apigee rejects the request.

4. Now try a creation request. This is intended to be the kind of REST request an
   app might send to create a new item within a collection:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$VIEWER_CLIENT_ID
   ```

   This request uses the credential that is authorized for the VIEWER product.

   You should again see a rejection response.  When an app uses the credential
   authorized for the VIEWER Product to request creation of a new user (`POST /apikey/users`), Apigee
   rejects the request.

## Test the APIs using API Key Verification (C)

5. Conversely, when you use the CREATOR credential for that kind of request, Apigee allows the request:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$CREATOR_CLIENT_ID
   ```

6. But when you use the CREATOR credential to request a DELETE on a specific user, Apigee rejects the request:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X DELETE https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users/1234 \
      -H APIKEY:$CREATOR_CLIENT_ID
   ```
   This is as expected; the CREATOR product does not grant authorization on `DELETE /apikey/users/1234`.

## Test the APIs using API Key Verification (D)

7. The set of operations on an API Product need not be grouped by verb.  A
   single API Product might be authorized for any set of verb+path combinations.

   For example, the ADMIN product is configured to allow GET, POST, or DELETE requests in that API Proxy. Using the ADMIN credential, all of the following should succeed:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users \
      -H APIKEY:$ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
   curl -i -X DELETE https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/apikey/users/1234 \
      -H APIKEY:$ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
   ```

## Test the APIs using OAuthV2 token Validation (A)

The above steps describe how to use an API Key as the credential. Apigee
performs the same checks when you configure your API Proxy to verify an OAuthV2
Bearer token.

To try that out, you will need to first obtain a valid token, and then pass it
in the same requests as shown above, just modifying the `apikey` path element to
be `token`, and passing a different header.


1. First, make sure that you have set the X\_CLIENT\_SECRET shell variables
   required for obtaining tokens. These are the companion variables
   corresponding to the CLIENT_ID variables you set earlier. If you have already
   done this, this step is unnecessary.

   ```sh
   export VIEWER_CLIENT_SECRET=<replace with script output>
   export CREATOR_CLIENT_SECRET=<replace with script output>
   export ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET=<replace with script output>
   ```

2. Now, run the following command, to obtain a token for the VIEWER.
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations-oauth2-cc/token \
       -u $VIEWER_CLIENT_ID:$VIEWER_CLIENT_SECRET -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
   ```
   You should see an access token in the response:
   ```json
   {
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "access_token": "dIrPeAlpORyrZCurH1CdY9brICcO",
     "grant_type": "client_credentials",
     "issued_at": 1687997951,
     "expires_in": 1799
   }
   ```
   Set a shell variable containing that access token:
   ```sh
   VIEWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<replace with the token in your curl output>
   ```

3. Invoke the /users API using the viewer token:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users \
      -H TOKEN:$VIEWER_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

## Test the APIs using OAuthV2 token Validation (B)

4. Now obtain a token for the creator.
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations-oauth2-cc/token \
       -u $CREATOR_CLIENT_ID:$CREATOR_CLIENT_SECRET -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
   ```
   and set the shell variable with the token shown in the response:
   ```sh
   CREATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN=<replace with token from curl output>
   ```

5. Use the creator token to invoke the /users API :
   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users \
      -H TOKEN:$CREATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   You should see this final request be rejected with a 401 status. This is
   expected, because the creator product does not grant authorization for the
   `GET /*/users` operation.

## Test the APIs using OAuthV2 token Validation (C)

6. Now try a creation request, using the viewer token:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users \
      -H TOKEN:$VIEWER_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   This request uses the credential that is authorized for the VIEWER product.

   You should again see a rejection response. When an app uses the credential
   authorized for the VIEWER Product to request creation of a new user, Apigee
   rejects the request. This is true whether the credential is an API Key or an
   Access Token.

7. Conversely, when you use the CREATOR credential for that kind of request, Apigee allows the request:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users \
      -H TOKEN:$CREATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   Again, as expected.


## Test the APIs using OAuthV2 token Validation (D)

8. Obtain a token for the admin:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X POST https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations-oauth2-cc/token \
       -u $ADMIN_CLIENT_ID:$ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
   ```
   and again, set the shell variable with the token shown in the response:
   ```sh
   ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=<replace with token from curl output>
   ```

9. Use it to invoke any API:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users \
      -H TOKEN:$ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
   curl -i -X POST -d '' https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users  \
      -H TOKEN:$ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
   curl -i -X DELETE https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users/1234  \
      -H TOKEN:$ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   All of these should succeed; the admin product grants authorization for all of those operations.

   But when you use the creator token to request a DELETE on a specific user:
   ```sh
   curl -i -X DELETE https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/apiproduct-operations/token/users/1234 \
      -H TOKEN:$CREATOR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   ..., Apigee rejects the request. This is as expected; the creator product
   does not grant authorization on `DELETE /token/users/1234`.
